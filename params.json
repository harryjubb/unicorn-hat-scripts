Included is `unicorntools.py`, a module with some extra helper functions for working with the HAT.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nCheck out the scripts themselves to see what they do. Although they're in development, I endeavour to comment what's going on at each step.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nAlways check through the code for each script and make sure you're happy with what it's doing. I haven't had any problems with them, but your mileage may vary. Each script is without warranty and for use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any fried Pis, HATs, or any other damages that may occur from use of the scripts.",
